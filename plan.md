Here's a concise, concrete plan for a web app presentation of a DoclingDocument for any sized PDF:

# Main considerations

- This is a pure LiveView app, no npm dependencies or package.json should be added.
- This is a single page viewer that takes the input from `priv/static/example.json`

# Steps

1. **Three-Pane Layout:**

   - **Sidebar (Navigation Tree):**
     - Display an interactive, collapsible tree reflecting the document’s hierarchy (sections, paragraphs, images, tables, etc.).
     - Use icons and abbreviated labels (e.g., "Title: ...", "Para", "Table") for a quick visual guide.
     - Allow text search/filtering to jump to specific content types or keywords.

2. **Main Content Panel:**

   - **Detailed View:**
     - When a node is selected, show its complete content. For text items, render formatted text; for images, display thumbnails or full images; and for tables, render an interactive grid.
     - Integrate inline editing or highlighting if needed.
   - **Interactive Page Thumbnails:**
     - Provide miniature page previews that can be clicked to navigate the content and reflect the document’s layout (using the bounding box metadata).

3. **Metadata/Properties Panel:**

   - Offer a secondary tab or side drawer that shows detailed metadata such as JSON pointers, bounding boxes, origin, and provenance of the selected item.
   - Use tooltips on hover over tree nodes for quick metadata insights without cluttering the view.

4. **Creative & Adaptive Features:**

   - **Zoom & Pan:** Enable users to zoom in/out on the document’s structural layout (e.g., a visual map of the page with highlighted zones) for large PDFs.
   - **Dynamic Filtering:** Allow filtering by content type (text, images, tables, forms) to simplify navigation in complex documents.
   - **Responsive Design:** Ensure that both the tree and content panels adapt to different screen sizes and can handle PDFs of any length or complexity.
   - **Animated Transitions:** Use smooth animations when expanding/collapsing nodes or switching between pages and metadata views to maintain a fluid user experience.

5. **Technology Stack Recommendations:**
   - Use **React.js** for building dynamic UI components and state management.
   - Leverage **D3.js** or a React tree component library for rendering and animating the hierarchical tree.
   - Integrate libraries like **Material-UI** for standard components (panels, tabs, buttons) to speed up design and ensure responsiveness.

This organization provides an intuitive, multi-layered approach: a clear overview of the document structure in the sidebar, detailed content and layout in the center, and deep metadata accessible on demand—all seamlessly scalable for large PDFs.
